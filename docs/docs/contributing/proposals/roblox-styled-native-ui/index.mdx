# Roblox styled native UI

<ProposalMeta frontMatter={frontMatter} />

Writing this from my phone but just wanted to get this idea down before I forget. But how do we feel about flipbook being styled closer to native Roblox plugins and elements in Studio. I like having our own style but I just get the idea that it might clash too much with everything around it and doesn't fit in well.
