# Introduction

Flipbook is a storybook plugin that previews UI components in a sandboxed environment. With it you can isolate distinct parts of your game's UI to hammer out edge cases and complex states without having to run through the whole UI.

By default, Flipbook uses a function-based renderer with support for Roblox Instances to get you up and running, and offers native support for UI libraries like [React](/docs/frameworks/react) and [Fusion](/docs/frameworks/fusion). No matter how you create UI you can write a story for it in Flipbook.
