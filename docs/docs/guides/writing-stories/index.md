# Writing Stories

Before Storyteller can discover your Stories, you need a Storybook. This is the topmost configuration for each collection of Stories in your project.

Create a Storybook anywhere in the DataModel, and set the `storyRoots` array to point to an instance that contains your Stories:

```lua
return {
	storyRoots = {
		script.Parent.Components
	},
}
```

The `storyRoots` array is the only required property in a Storybook, and can manage many "roots," where a root  is simply an Instance that has Story modules nested inside it.

By default, Storyteller uses a function-based renderer with support for Roblox Instances to get you up and running. The following is all you need to be compatible with Storyteller:

```lua
return {
	story = function()
	  local label = Instance.new("TextLabel")
	  label.Text = "Hello, World!"

	  return label
	end
}
```

Storyteller also has built-in support for prominent UI libraries like React and Fusion. You can tell Storyteller to use a particular UI library by supplying the `packages` object.

```lua
local React = require("@pkg/React")
local ReactRoblox = require("@pkg/ReactRoblox")

return {
	story = React.createElement("TextLabel", {
		label.Text = "Hello, World!"
	}),
	packages = {
		React = React,
		ReactRoblox = ReactRoblox
	}
}
```

It can be tedious to supply the `packages` object in each Story module, which is why itâ€™s more common to add them globally in the Storybook module so that all Stories can render with the UI library you use across your project.

```lua
local React = require("@pkg/React")

return {
	story = React.createElement("TextLabel", {
		label.Text = "Hello, World!"
	}),
}
```

```lua
local React = require("@pkg/React")
local ReactRoblox = require("@pkg/ReactRoblox")

return {
	storyRoots = { script.Parent.Components },
	packages = {
		React = React,
		ReactRoblox = ReactRoblox
	}
}
```

## Manual story

Return value is a function. `target` is not implicitly cleaned in this case
```lua
return {
    story = function(target, props)
        local gui = Instance.new("TextLabel")
        gui.Parent = target

        return function()
            gui:Destroy()
        end
    end
}
```

Return value is an Instance. Renderer will implicitly Parent the Instance to the container and call Destroy when unmounting

```lua
return {
    story = function(props)
        local gui = Instance.new("TextLabel")

        return gui
    end
}
```

No return value. Renderer will implicitly call `ClearAllChildren` on the container, but no other efforts will be made to cleanup side-effects of the story

```lua
return {
    story = function(props)
        local gui = Instance.new("TextLabel")
    end
}
```

## UI Labs and Hoarcekat

```lua
return function(target: Instance, props: { [string]: any })
    local gui = Instance.new("TextLabel")
    gui.Parent = target

    return function()
        gui:Destroy()
    end
end
```
