# Roact

Flipbook supports Roblox's legacy [Roact](https://github.com/roblox/roact) library. Pass in your installation of Roact to your Storybook and all stories will be rendered with it.

:::info
Roact is an archived repository that we consider to be legacy software. We recommend the use of [React](/docs/frameworks/react) for new work. Flipbook aims to support Roact for the forseeable future, but reserves the option to remove support in future major versions.
