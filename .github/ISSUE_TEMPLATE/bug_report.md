## Error message, screenshots, and extra context

<!--
    Error messages are a big help as it allows us to see where something may be
    going wrong. Similarly, any screenshots can help us narrow down what state
    the plugin is in which can provide necessary context to fixing the issue.

	Feel free to include any extra context you feel could help with resolving
	the issue as well.
