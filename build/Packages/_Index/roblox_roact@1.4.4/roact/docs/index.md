Roact is a *declarative* Lua UI library similar to Facebook's [React](https://reactjs.org). It exposes a very similar API and implements nearly identical semantics.

This documentation is based on the structure of React's documentation, but is a work in progress. Many things from React also apply to Roact, but if you find anything missing or incorrect, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/issues)!

!!! info
	This documentation assumes some familiarity with Lua. If you're new to Lua, [*Programming in Lua* by Roberto Ierusalimschy](https://www.lua.org/pil/) is a good introduction, and the first edition (for Lua 5.0) is available online for free.
