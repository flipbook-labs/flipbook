	Symbols have the type 'userdata', but when printed or coerced to a string,
	the symbol will turn into the string given as its name.

	**This implementation provides only the `Symbol()` constructor and the
	global registry via `Symbol.for_`.**

	Other behaviors, including the ability to find all symbol properties on
	objects, are not implemented.
