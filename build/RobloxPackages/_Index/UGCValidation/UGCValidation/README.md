# UGC Validation

## Local Testing

TODO

## Publishing

As of June 2024, you require this version of rotriever https://github.com/Roblox/rotriever/releases/tag/v0.5.13-alpha.2 in order to publish

### Publishing a new version

1. In this repo, update `rotriever.toml`'s "version" field and merge the change to the `main` branch
2. Run this Github Action https://github.com/Roblox/ugc-validation/actions/workflows/publish.yml (select the `Run workflow` dropdown, then press the `Run workflow` button)
3. Locally on the 'main' branch (which has the rotriever.toml change made above), remove the entire `[config]` section from C:\Git\ugc-validation\rotriever.toml (this change is a hack to make running `rotrieve publish origin` work). Create a branch locally and commit the change to the branch (don't push the branch)
4. Locally on the branch, from `C:\Git\ugc-validation` run `rotrieve publish origin`
   - Note: if you don't have rotrieve, download it from https://github.com/Roblox/rotriever/releases, then unzip it to use the exe
   - Note: missing packages may be reported. Install them with pip install and re-run
   - the result of successfully running should be a new entry in https://github.com/Roblox/ugc-validation/tags
5. You can now delete the local branch with the rotriever.toml edit (the edit which removed the `[config]` section)
6. [Run this TeamCity job](https://teamcity-sage.rbx.com/buildConfiguration/App_Lua_Tools_CacheRotrieverPackage05x)
   - Package Source: github.com/Roblox/ugc-validation
   - Package name: UGCValidation
   - Version: [version from step 1]
