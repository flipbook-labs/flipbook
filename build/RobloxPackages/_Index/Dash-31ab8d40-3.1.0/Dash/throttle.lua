	Creates and returns a new throttled version of the passed function which will ensure that the function is
	called at most once during the specified wait period. If called multiple times during the wait period, only
	the first call will be executed immediately, and subsequent calls will be ignored until the wait period has elapsed.

	The last call will always be done after the same delay.
	```

	@param func The function to throttle.
	@param wait The number of seconds to throttle invocations to.
	@param options Optional throttle options:
		- leading: boolean? (if true, call at the start of the window; default true)
		- trailing: boolean? (if true, call at the end of the window; default true)
	@return The new throttled function.
	@example
	```luau
		local throttled = throttle(function(v) print(v) end, 0.1)
		for i = 1, 10 do
			throttled(i)
		end
		-- Would result in:
		-- 1
		-- 10

				    after the full delay from now, not some huge negative value.
				  - On subsequent calls, baseTime is lastExecutionTime, so (now - baseTime) gives us the elapsed time
				    since the last execution, and (delay - (now - baseTime)) is the remaining time to wait.
				This ensures that the trailing call is always scheduled to run at the end of the throttle window,
				regardless of when the first or last call happened.
