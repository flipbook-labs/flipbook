--[[
    PresenceContext.lua
    
    Creates the React Context used throughout the animation system to share presence state.
    This context allows components to:
    - Know if they are present/visible
    - Access their unique presence ID
    - Coordinate exit animations
    - Share custom data between presence components
    
    The context is consumed by usePresence hook and provided by PresenceChild/PresenceProvider
