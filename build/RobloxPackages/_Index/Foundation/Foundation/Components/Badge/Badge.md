## Overview

`Badge` is a stylized, presentational user interface element. This simple component is used to display notification counts on icons or additional info such as "NEW" or "Sale" on tiles.

There are six badge variants defined in [[BadgeVariant]]: `Neutral`, `Contrast`, `Alert`, `Warning`, `Success` and `OverMedia`.

Text and icon content type can be added any of the badges

* If icon is nil then it will be a text-only badge
* If text is nil then it will be an icon-only badge
* If text and icon are nil it will be a (small, empty state) blank badge
* Otherwise, it will be an icon and text badge

## Usage

`Badge`s will grow to fit their text. Badge text does *not* wrap to multiple lines.

`Badge` text has `RichText` enabled by default to support custom colorization of the `text` prop.

```luau
local Foundation = require(Packages.Foundation)
local Badge = Foundation.Badge
local BadgeVariant = Foundation.Enums.BadgeVariant

return React.createElement(Badge, {
	icon = "icons/menu/clothing/limited_on",
	text = "#100",
	variant = BadgeVariant.Neutral,
})
```
