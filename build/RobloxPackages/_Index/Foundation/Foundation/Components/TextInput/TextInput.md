## Overview

`TextInput` is a single line text input with optional label, helper text, and icons.

---

## Usage

`TextInput` has a default width of 400px unless `width` is specified. The height is static and will depend on whether a label and helper text are provided.

The `isRequired` property should only be used on the inputs that fall in the minority. For example, if most inputs are required, only put `isRequired = false,` on the optional inputs, and `isRequired` as `nil` for the required inputs.

The `textBoxRef` property exposes additional imperative functions to the TextBox. Currently this exposes: <br>`focus()`, which
focuses the textbox.
<br>`releaseFocus()`, which unfocuses the textbox.
<br>`getIsFocused()`, which returns whether the TextBox is currently focused.

```luau
local Foundation = require(Packages.Foundation)
local TextInput = Foundation.TextInput

local function Component()
	local text, setText = React.useState("")
	local textBoxRef = React.useRef(nil)
	return React.createElement(TextInput, {
		text = text,
		placeholder = "Placeholder text",
		isRequired = true,
		label = "Username",
		help = "Must be alphanumeric",
		textBoxRef = textBoxRef,
		onChanged = function(txt)
			setText(txt)
		end,
		LayoutOrder = 1,
	})
end
```
