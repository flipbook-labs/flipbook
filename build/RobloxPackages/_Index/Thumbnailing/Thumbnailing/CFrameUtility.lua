	We can use this for other things than a head, but I am going to talk

	Same idea as CalculateTargetCFrame, then we adjust the result so that Position of
	CFrame is adjusted by center of Extents.  Extents are expressed in terms of
	original targetCFrame.

	So again using an example where targetCFrame describes position/orientation of Head:
		- Suppose user has no hair, just a bald head.
		  Then minExtent = (-headSizeX/2, -headSizeY/2, -headSizeZ/2) and
		  Then maxExtent = (headSizeX/2, headSizeY/2, headSizeZ/2) and
		  Adjustment to CFrame Position is 0.
		- Suppose user is wearing a very tall narrow hat perched at the very top of the head.
		  Then minExtent = (-headSizeX/2, -headSizeY/2, -headSizeZ/2) and
		  Then maxExtent = (headSizeX/2, headSizeY/2 + hatSizeY, headSizeZ/2) and
		  Adjustment to CFrame position is +hatSizeY/2.
